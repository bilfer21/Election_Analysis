# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this analysis is to determine voting statistics for three three counties (Arapahoe, Denver, Jefferson) in Colorado to verify election results among three candidates (Raymon Doane, Diana DeGette, Charles Stockham). Specifically, the analysis seeks to tabualte total votes, votes by county and percentage of total, votes by candidate and percentage of total, and ultimately determine the winning candidate of the popular vote. The analysis was performed on raw data that was generated from all acceptable voting methods in the election.

## Election Audit Results

The analysis of election results shows that 369,711 total votes were cast across the three counties. Denver county had the higher voter turnout, with 306,055 votes cast (82.8% of total), Jefferson county had 38,855 votes cast (10.5% of total), and Arapahoe county had the lowest number of votes cast with 24,801 (6.7% of total). Among the candidates, Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes (73.8% of total), Charles Stockham received 85,213 votes (23.0% of total), and Raymon Doane received 11,606 votes (3.1% of total). Based on the results of the audit, the winner of the election based on popular vote totals was Diana DeGette, garnering 272,892 votes (73.8%) of all votes cast.


## Election Audit Summary

Based on the results of the audit, the script that was designed for tabulating votes by county and candidate could be broadly used in determining election results. The implementation of slight modifications, such as altering the path needed to link to the source data, would allow the script to be utilized across a multitude of elections.
